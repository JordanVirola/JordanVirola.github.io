    <div>You continue driving up Mt. Akina, it's around 10pm on a Saturday and you can't see anything without your headlights, you still think about turning around but before you can , you reach the peak and see your friends waiting with a large crowd of people around them. You can also see your rival, Takeshi Nakazato leaning on his jet black Nissan R32, you drive past him and turn your car around, parking it next to him.</div>
