    <div>You decide to pull out of the race. You didn't think you had the guts to go through with it in the first place but you have a nagging feeling in the back of your head, you could've won this and put Takeshi to shame. You drive back to your fathers tofu shop, he's a former racer with a legendary satus, he's not happy with you pulling out of the race. You will never hear the end of this night. <br>YOU LOSE!</div>
